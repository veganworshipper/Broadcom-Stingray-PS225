# Broadcom Stingray PS225 Research Project

## Overview

This repository documents the reverse engineering, analysis, firmware investigation, and bring-up efforts surrounding the Broadcom Stingray PS225 SmartNIC platform.

The goal of this project is to identify hardware variants, document firmware architecture, understand platform capabilities, and ultimately bring previously undocumented PS225 cards into operational use under Linux.

## What Is The PS225?

The PS225 is not a traditional Ethernet adapter.

Evidence collected from Linux drivers, Broadcom documentation, firmware interfaces, and community research indicates the PS225 is a member of the Broadcom Stingray family of SmartNICs / DPUs.

At its core is the:

- Broadcom BCM58802 Stingray SoC
- ARM Cortex-A72 subsystem
- Onboard DDR4 memory
- Onboard eMMC storage
- 25GbE network interfaces
- RoCE / RDMA acceleration
- SR-IOV virtualization support
- Secure Boot infrastructure

Vendor ID:

```
14e4:d802
```

Linux Identification:

```
Broadcom BCM58802 Stingray 50Gb Ethernet SoC
```

## Known Memory Configurations

Evidence currently suggests the existence of at least:

| DDR4 | eMMC |
|--------|--------|
| 8GB | 16GB |
| 16GB | 64GB |

Additional variants may exist.

---

## Broadcom Stingray Architecture

Based on Broadcom public documentation:

- Up to 8x ARM Cortex-A72 cores
- PCIe Gen3
- Integrated Ethernet controller
- RoCE acceleration
- NVMe-over-Fabric support
- Hardware packet processing
- 16nm FinFET process

---

# Firmware Architecture

Unlike conventional NICs, the PS225 appears to contain multiple independent firmware domains.

## CHIMP

Responsible for:

- HWRM processing
- Management
- Configuration
- Firmware services

## KONG

Responsible for:

- Dataplane processing
- Flow management
- RoCE services
- CFA / TruFlow operations

## Additional Firmware Components

Discovered through Broadcom NVM definitions:

- APE Firmware
- KONG Firmware
- BONO Firmware
- TANG Firmware

Each component supports independent firmware and patch images.

---

# HWRM Capability Discovery

The Broadcom HWRM interface exposes the following capabilities.

## Security

- Secure Firmware Updates
- Secure Boot Capable
- Secure SoC Capable
- Debug Token Support

## Virtualization

- Trusted VF Support
- VirtIO vSwitch Offload

## Dataplane

- KONG Mailbox Channel
- Flow Aging
- Advanced Flow Counters
- CFA Advanced Flow Management
- CFA TruFlow

# NVM Layout

Broadcom stores firmware and configuration inside a directory-based NVM structure.

Known object types include:

| Type | Description |
|--------|--------|
| BOOTCODE | Bootloader |
| VPD | Vital Product Data |
| APE_FW | APE Firmware |
| KONG_FW | KONG Firmware |
| BONO_FW | BONO Firmware |
| TANG_FW | TANG Firmware |
| SHARED_CFG | Shared Configuration |
| PORT_CFG | Port Configuration |
| FUNC_CFG | Function Configuration |
| MGMT_CFG | Management Configuration |
| MGMT_DATA | Management Data |
| MGMT_EVENT_LOG | Event Log |
| MGMT_AUDIT_LOG | Audit Log |

---

# RoCE / RDMA

The Linux driver exposes structures associated with:

- Queue Pairs (QP)
- Completion Queues (CQ)
- Shared Receive Queues (SRQ)
- Memory Regions (MR)

This confirms the presence of hardware RDMA support.

---

# Secure Platform Features

The BCM58802 firmware advertises:

- Secure Boot Capable
- Secure SoC Capable
- Debug Token Support

Additional manufacturing and provisioning commands exist for:

- Certificate import/export
- OTP configuration
- Secure firmware updates

This strongly suggests the platform implements a hardware root-of-trust architecture.

---

# Debug Infrastructure

Broadcom exposes a large engineering command set not normally used by standard operating systems.

Examples include:

- Direct register access
- Indirect register access
- Firmware CLI
- I²C access
- NVM erase operations
- Crash dump generation
- Trace facilities
- Debug token management

These commands appear within a dedicated debug opcode range:

```
0xFF0E - 0xFF30
```

---

# Crash Dump Framework

The Stingray platform contains a sophisticated diagnostic framework capable of collecting:

- Firmware dumps
- Driver dumps
- SoC DDR dumps
- Host DDR dumps

Known dumpable components include:

- KONG
- HWRM
- VNIC
- RDMA Queues
- Statistics Contexts

---

# RouterOS Discovery

Community reports have demonstrated:

- RouterOS CHR running directly on a PS225-H16
- Proxmox remaining operational on the host
- Network functions exposed to virtual machines

This confirms that at least some Stingray variants are capable of executing complete operating systems on the ARM subsystem.

---
